Background
In recent years, the flow of patients to the Emergency Departments (ED) of Western countries has steadily increased, thus generating overcrowding and extended waiting times. Scholars have identified four main causes for this phenomenon, related to: continuity of primary care services; availability of specific clinical pathways for chronic patients; ED’s personnel endowment; organization of the ED. This study aims at providing a logical diagnostic framework to support managers in investigating specific solutions to be applied to their EDs to cope with high ED waiting times. The framework is based on the ED waiting times and ED admission rate matrix. It was applied to the Tuscan EDs as illustrative example.

Methods
To provide the factors to be analyzed once the EDs are positioned into the matrix, a list of issues has been identified. The matrix was applied to Tuscan EDs. Data were collected from the Tuscan performance evaluation system, integrated with specific data on Tuscan EDs’ personnel. The Tuscan EDs matrix, the descriptive statistics for each quadrant and the Spearman’s rank correlation analysis among waiting times, admission rates and a set of performance indicators were conducted to help managers to read the phenomena that they need to investigate.

Results
The combined reading of the correlations and waiting times-admission rates matrix shows that there are no optimal rules for all the EDs in managing admission rates and waiting times, but solutions have to be found considering mixed and personalized strategies.

Conclusions
The waiting times-admission rates matrix provides a tool able to support managers in detecting the problems related to the management of ED services. In particular, using this matrix, healthcare managers could be facilitated in the identification of possible solutions for their specific situation.},

  abstract     = {Background Long lengths of stay (also called waiting times) in emergency departments (EDs) are associated with higher patient mortality and worse outcomes.Objective To add to the literature using high-frequency data from a large number of hospitals to analyse factors associated with long waiting times, including exploring non-linearities for {\textquoteright}tipping points{\textquoteright}.Methods Multivariate ordinary least squares regressions with fixed effects were used to analyse factors associated with the proportion of patients in EDs in England waiting more than 4 hours to be seen, treated and admitted or discharged. Daily situation reports (Sitrep), hospital episode statistics and electronic staffing records data over 90 days between December 2016 and February 2017 were used for all 138 English NHS healthcare providers with a major ED.Results Higher inpatient bed occupancy was correlated with longer ED waiting times, with a non-linear association. In a full hospital, with 100\% bed occupancy, the proportion of patients who remained in the ED for more than 4 hours was 9 percentage points higher (95\% CI 7.5\% to 11.1\%) than with an 85\% occupancy level. For each percentage point change in the following factors, the proportion of ED stays over 4 hours also increased: more inpatients with hospital length of stay over 21 days (0.07\%, 95\% CI 0.008\% to 0.13\%); higher emergency admissions (0.08\%, 95\% CI 0.06\% to 0.10\%); and lower discharges relative to admissions on the same day (0.04\%, 95\% CI 0.02\% to 0.06\%), the following day (0.05\%, 95\% CI 0.03\% to 0.06\%) and at 2 days (0.05\%, 95\% CI 0.04\% to 0.07\%).Conclusions These results suggest that tackling patient flow and capacity in the wider hospital, particularly very high bed occupancy levels and patient discharge, is important to reduce ED waiting times and improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract       = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an important concept, bridging the physical and digital worlds through interconnected devices. Although the idea of interconnected devices predates the term “Internet of Things”, which was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the vision of a seamlessly integrated world of devices has been accelerated by advancements in wireless technologies, cost-effective computing, and the ubiquity of mobile devices. This study aims to provide an in-depth review of existing and emerging IoT simulators focusing on their capabilities and real-world applications, and discuss the current challenges and future trends in the IoT simulation area. Despite substantial research in the IoT simulation domain, many studies have a narrow focus, leaving a gap in comprehensive reviews that consider broader IoT development metrics, such as device mobility, energy models, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and scalability. Notably, there is a lack of literature examining IoT simulators’ capabilities in supporting renewable energy sources and their integration with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulations. Our review seeks to address this gap, evaluating the ability of IoT simulators to simulate complex, large-scale IoT scenarios and meet specific developmental requirements, as well as examining the current challenges and future trends in the field of IoT simulation. Our systematic analysis has identified several significant gaps in the current literature. A primary concern is the lack of a generic simulator capable of effectively simulating various scenarios across different domains within the IoT environment. As a result, a comprehensive and versatile simulator is required to simulate the diverse scenarios occurring in IoT applications. Additionally, there is a notable gap in simulators that address specific security concerns, particularly battery depletion attacks, which are increasingly relevant in IoT systems. Furthermore, there is a need for further investigation and study regarding the integration of IoT simulators with traffic simulation for VANET environments. In addition, it is noteworthy that renewable energy sources are underrepresented in IoT simulations, despite an increasing global emphasis on environmental sustainability. As a result of these identified gaps, it is imperative to develop more advanced and adaptable IoT simulation tools that are designed to meet the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the IoT domain.},

Internet of things (IoT) enables machine-to-machine, human-to-human and machine-to-human interaction. Recent advancement in IoT systems has positively impacted the daily activities of humans, from accessing information to the delivery of service in real-time. This has improved healthcare management and services, especially in medical hospitals, for effective and timely access to diagnostic information and treatment of patients. Several existing research mainly focused on the design of IoT architecture, its challenges, and benefits to human society with minor or without considering applying IoT in the healthcare domain. To bridge this gap, this study investigates the implications of IoT integration in the healthcare management domain. It presents a detailed discussion on IoT utilization to improve the functionalities of hospital management system. It also discusses some potential emerging innovations that aids the development and application of IoT in hospital management systems. Investigations show that healthcare personnel can administer treatments to patients anytime–anywhere. Patients, especially the elderly are administered treatment, as well as monitoring their wellbeing while at home with the support of wearable sensor devices. Also, some of the challenges that impedes the integration of IoT application into healthcare domain includes generation of irrelevant huge amount of data, issues of security and privacy of patient information and high cost of IoT adoption. Furthermore, the future research trends in adoption of IoT to improve healthcare domain includes stroke and epileptic seizure predictions and prosthetic sensors which is used to retrieve relevant data or information to aid the treatment of a patient in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Increasing numbers of devices that output large amounts of geographically referenced data are being deployed as the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand. Partly as a result of the IoT's dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous architecture. These are all examples of the Internet of items (IoT), despite the fact that we might be thinking that one of these items is different from the others. The physical and digital worlds are connected by the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, one of the key goals of the Internet is its own development. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of IoT-based data quality and data preparation strategies developed with multinational corporations in mind. The goal is to make IoT data more trustworthy and practical so that MNCs may use it to their advantage in making educated business decisions. The proposed structure consists of three distinct actions: gathering data, evaluating data quality, and cleaning up raw data. Data preprocessing research is essential since it decides and significantly affects the accuracy of predictions made in later stages. Thus, the recommendation for a special and useful combination in the framework of different data preprocessing task types, which includes the following four technical elements and is briefly justified, is made. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a design pattern in which commonplace items can be equipped with classification, sensing, networking, and processing capabilities that will enable them to communicate with one another over the Internet to fulfill a specific function. The Internet of Things will eventually change physical objects into virtual objects with intelligence. In addition to a detailed analysis of the IoT layer, this article gives an overview of the existing Internet of Things (IoT), technical specifics, and applications in this recently growing field. However, this publication will provide future scholars who desire to conduct study in this area of Internet of Things with a better knowledge.},
