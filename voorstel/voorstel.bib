Background
In recent years, the flow of patients to the Emergency Departments (ED) of Western countries has steadily increased, thus generating overcrowding and extended waiting times. Scholars have identified four main causes for this phenomenon, related to: continuity of primary care services; availability of specific clinical pathways for chronic patients; ED’s personnel endowment; organization of the ED. This study aims at providing a logical diagnostic framework to support managers in investigating specific solutions to be applied to their EDs to cope with high ED waiting times. The framework is based on the ED waiting times and ED admission rate matrix. It was applied to the Tuscan EDs as illustrative example.

Methods
To provide the factors to be analyzed once the EDs are positioned into the matrix, a list of issues has been identified. The matrix was applied to Tuscan EDs. Data were collected from the Tuscan performance evaluation system, integrated with specific data on Tuscan EDs’ personnel. The Tuscan EDs matrix, the descriptive statistics for each quadrant and the Spearman’s rank correlation analysis among waiting times, admission rates and a set of performance indicators were conducted to help managers to read the phenomena that they need to investigate.

Results
The combined reading of the correlations and waiting times-admission rates matrix shows that there are no optimal rules for all the EDs in managing admission rates and waiting times, but solutions have to be found considering mixed and personalized strategies.

Conclusions
The waiting times-admission rates matrix provides a tool able to support managers in detecting the problems related to the management of ED services. In particular, using this matrix, healthcare managers could be facilitated in the identification of possible solutions for their specific situation.},

  abstract     = {Background Long lengths of stay (also called waiting times) in emergency departments (EDs) are associated with higher patient mortality and worse outcomes.Objective To add to the literature using high-frequency data from a large number of hospitals to analyse factors associated with long waiting times, including exploring non-linearities for {\textquoteright}tipping points{\textquoteright}.Methods Multivariate ordinary least squares regressions with fixed effects were used to analyse factors associated with the proportion of patients in EDs in England waiting more than 4 hours to be seen, treated and admitted or discharged. Daily situation reports (Sitrep), hospital episode statistics and electronic staffing records data over 90 days between December 2016 and February 2017 were used for all 138 English NHS healthcare providers with a major ED.Results Higher inpatient bed occupancy was correlated with longer ED waiting times, with a non-linear association. In a full hospital, with 100\% bed occupancy, the proportion of patients who remained in the ED for more than 4 hours was 9 percentage points higher (95\% CI 7.5\% to 11.1\%) than with an 85\% occupancy level. For each percentage point change in the following factors, the proportion of ED stays over 4 hours also increased: more inpatients with hospital length of stay over 21 days (0.07\%, 95\% CI 0.008\% to 0.13\%); higher emergency admissions (0.08\%, 95\% CI 0.06\% to 0.10\%); and lower discharges relative to admissions on the same day (0.04\%, 95\% CI 0.02\% to 0.06\%), the following day (0.05\%, 95\% CI 0.03\% to 0.06\%) and at 2 days (0.05\%, 95\% CI 0.04\% to 0.07\%).Conclusions These results suggest that tackling patient flow and capacity in the wider hospital, particularly very high bed occupancy levels and patient discharge, is important to reduce ED waiting times and improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract       = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an important concept, bridging the physical and digital worlds through interconnected devices. Although the idea of interconnected devices predates the term “Internet of Things”, which was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the vision of a seamlessly integrated world of devices has been accelerated by advancements in wireless technologies, cost-effective computing, and the ubiquity of mobile devices. This study aims to provide an in-depth review of existing and emerging IoT simulators focusing on their capabilities and real-world applications, and discuss the current challenges and future trends in the IoT simulation area. Despite substantial research in the IoT simulation domain, many studies have a narrow focus, leaving a gap in comprehensive reviews that consider broader IoT development metrics, such as device mobility, energy models, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and scalability. Notably, there is a lack of literature examining IoT simulators’ capabilities in supporting renewable energy sources and their integration with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulations. Our review seeks to address this gap, evaluating the ability of IoT simulators to simulate complex, large-scale IoT scenarios and meet specific developmental requirements, as well as examining the current challenges and future trends in the field of IoT simulation. Our systematic analysis has identified several significant gaps in the current literature. A primary concern is the lack of a generic simulator capable of effectively simulating various scenarios across different domains within the IoT environment. As a result, a comprehensive and versatile simulator is required to simulate the diverse scenarios occurring in IoT applications. Additionally, there is a notable gap in simulators that address specific security concerns, particularly battery depletion attacks, which are increasingly relevant in IoT systems. Furthermore, there is a need for further investigation and study regarding the integration of IoT simulators with traffic simulation for VANET environments. In addition, it is noteworthy that renewable energy sources are underrepresented in IoT simulations, despite an increasing global emphasis on environmental sustainability. As a result of these identified gaps, it is imperative to develop more advanced and adaptable IoT simulation tools that are designed to meet the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the IoT domain.},

Internet of things (IoT) enables machine-to-machine, human-to-human and machine-to-human interaction. Recent advancement in IoT systems has positively impacted the daily activities of humans, from accessing information to the delivery of service in real-time. This has improved healthcare management and services, especially in medical hospitals, for effective and timely access to diagnostic information and treatment of patients. Several existing research mainly focused on the design of IoT architecture, its challenges, and benefits to human society with minor or without considering applying IoT in the healthcare domain. To bridge this gap, this study investigates the implications of IoT integration in the healthcare management domain. It presents a detailed discussion on IoT utilization to improve the functionalities of hospital management system. It also discusses some potential emerging innovations that aids the development and application of IoT in hospital management systems. Investigations show that healthcare personnel can administer treatments to patients anytime–anywhere. Patients, especially the elderly are administered treatment, as well as monitoring their wellbeing while at home with the support of wearable sensor devices. Also, some of the challenges that impedes the integration of IoT application into healthcare domain includes generation of irrelevant huge amount of data, issues of security and privacy of patient information and high cost of IoT adoption. Furthermore, the future research trends in adoption of IoT to improve healthcare domain includes stroke and epileptic seizure predictions and prosthetic sensors which is used to retrieve relevant data or information to aid the treatment of a patient in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Increasing numbers of devices that output large amounts of geographically referenced data are being deployed as the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand. Partly as a result of the IoT's dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous architecture. These are all examples of the Internet of items (IoT), despite the fact that we might be thinking that one of these items is different from the others. The physical and digital worlds are connected by the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, one of the key goals of the Internet is its own development. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of IoT-based data quality and data preparation strategies developed with multinational corporations in mind. The goal is to make IoT data more trustworthy and practical so that MNCs may use it to their advantage in making educated business decisions. The proposed structure consists of three distinct actions: gathering data, evaluating data quality, and cleaning up raw data. Data preprocessing research is essential since it decides and significantly affects the accuracy of predictions made in later stages. Thus, the recommendation for a special and useful combination in the framework of different data preprocessing task types, which includes the following four technical elements and is briefly justified, is made. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a design pattern in which commonplace items can be equipped with classification, sensing, networking, and processing capabilities that will enable them to communicate with one another over the Internet to fulfill a specific function. The Internet of Things will eventually change physical objects into virtual objects with intelligence. In addition to a detailed analysis of the IoT layer, this article gives an overview of the existing Internet of Things (IoT), technical specifics, and applications in this recently growing field. However, this publication will provide future scholars who desire to conduct study in this area of Internet of Things with a better knowledge.},

  abstract       = {Smart buildings use advanced technologies to automate building functions. One important function is occupancy detection using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for smart buildings. Occupancy information is useful information to reduce energy consumption by automating building functions such as lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The information is useful to improve indoor air quality by ensuring that ventilation systems are used only when and where they are needed. Additionally, it is useful to enhance building security by detecting unusual or unexpected occupancy levels and triggering appropriate responses, such as alarms or alerts. Occupancy information is useful for many other applications, such as emergency response, plug load energy management, point-of-interest identification, etc. However, the accuracy of occupancy detection is limited by factors such as real-time occupancy data, sensor placement, privacy concerns, and the presence of pets or objects that can interfere with sensor reading. With the rapid development of IoT sensor technologies and the increasing need for smart building solutions, there is a growing interest in occupancy detection techniques. There is a need to provide a comprehensive survey of these technologies. Although there are some exciting survey papers, they all have limited scopes with different focuses. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art occupancy detection methods (including both traditional algorithms and machine learning algorithms) and devices with their advantages and limitations. It surveys and compares fundamental technologies (such as sensors, algorithms, etc.) for smart buildings. Furthermore, the survey provides insights and discussions, which can help researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders develop more effective occupancy detection solutions for smart buildings.},

  abstract       = {In today’s world, a significant amount of global energy is used in buildings. Unfortunately, a lot of this energy is wasted, because electrical appliances are not used properly or efficiently. One way to reduce this waste is by detecting, learning, and predicting when people are present in buildings. To do this, buildings need to become “smart” and “cognitive” and use modern technologies to sense when and how people are occupying the buildings. By leveraging this information, buildings can make smart decisions based on recently developed methods. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that have been designed and used for the monitoring of indoor environmental conditions within buildings. Using these technologies is crucial to gathering data about the indoor environment and determining the number and presence of occupants. Furthermore, this paper critically examines both the strengths and limitations of each technology in predicting occupant behavior. In addition, it explores different methods for processing these data and making future occupancy predictions. Moreover, we highlight some challenges, such as determining the optimal number and location of sensors and radars, and provide a detailed explanation and insights into these challenges. Furthermore, the paper explores possible future directions, including the security of occupants’ data and the promotion of energy-efficient practices such as localizing occupants and monitoring their activities within a building. With respect to other survey works on similar topics, our work aims to both cover recent sensory approaches and review methods used in the literature for estimating occupancy.},

  abstract     = {Hospital productivity is of great importance to policymakers, and previous research demonstrates that improved hospital productivity can be achieved by directing more focus towards patient throughput at healthcare organizations. There is also a growing body of literature on patient throughput barriers hampering the flow of patients. These projects rarely, however, encompass complete hospitals. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic literature review on hospital-wide patient process throughput barriers by consolidating the substantial body of studies from single settings into a hospital-wide perspective. Our review yielded a total of 2207 articles, of which 92 were finally selected for analysis. The results reveal long lead times, inefficient capacity coordination and inefficient patient process transfer as the main barriers at hospitals. These are caused by inadequate staffing, lack of standards and routines, insufficient operational planning and a lack in IT functions. As such, this review provides new perspectives on whether the root causes of inefficient hospital patient throughput are related to resource insufficiency or inefficient work methods. Finally, this study develops a new hospital-wide framework to be used by policymakers and healthcare managers when deciding what improvement strategies to follow to increase patient throughput at hospitals.},

A comprehensive review and a bibliometric analysis were performed to objectively summarize the growth of IoT research in healthcare. To begin, 2,990 journal articles were carefully selected for further investigation. These publications were analyzed based on various bibliometric metrics, including publication year, journals, authors, institutions, and countries. Keyword co-occurrence and co-citation networks were generated to unravel significant research hotspots. The findings show that IoT research has received considerable interest from the healthcare community. Based on the results of the keyword co-occurrence network, IoT healthcare applications, blockchain applications, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, 5G telecommunications, as well as data analytics and computing technologies emerged as important topics. The co-citation network analysis reveals other important themes, including authentication schemes, fog computing, cloud-IoT integration, and cognitive smart healthcare. Overall, the review offers scholars an improved understanding of the current status of IoT research in healthcare and identifies knowledge gaps for future research. This review also informs healthcare professionals about the latest developments and applications of IoT in the healthcare sector.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a development of motion detection technique with an IoT-based Home Security System. Two low-cost motion detectors, namely, pyroelectric infrared radial (PIR) and microwave sensors are considered in this work, and a Raspberry Pi is selected as the main platform to receive the sensor signals and send a push notification to the user whenever an intruder is detected. The performance of each sensor was firstly analysed in terms of its detection accuracy and false activation. A series of experiments were designed in a car porch area with various walking trajectories to evaluate the accuracy of each sensor, and three environmental scenario with different wind speeds were considered for the evaluation on false triggers. We also introduce a simple algorithm for each sensor to minimize the effects from the sensors' noise. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the microwave sensor outperforms the PIR in terms of both detection accuracy and false activation. It is also observed that, the implementation of the algorithm offers a great reduction in terms of false activation, but with a slight trade-off in motion detection accuracy. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the microwave sensor is enhanced as the false trigger can be totally eliminated at the cost of only 5{\%} accuracy reduction, compared to that of the PIR sensor which still shows a non-zero false triggers with 6.25{\%} accuracy reduction after the implementation of the algorithm.},

  abstract       = {Currently, big sensor data arise in a wide spectrum of Industry 4.0, Internet of Things, and Smart City applications. In such subject domains, sensors tend to have a high frequency and produce massive time series in a relatively short time interval. The data collected from the sensors are subject to mining in order to make strategic decisions. In the article, we consider the problem of choosing a Time Series Database Management System (TSDBMS) to provide efficient storing and mining of big sensor data. We overview InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, and TimescaleDB, which are among the most popular state-of-the-art TSDBMSs, and represent different categories of such systems, namely native, add-ons over NoSQL systems, and add-ons over relational DBMSs (RDBMSs), respectively. Our overview shows that, at present, TSDBMSs offer a modest built-in toolset to mine big sensor data. This leads to the use of third-party mining systems and unwanted overhead costs due to exporting data outside a TSDBMS, data conversion, and so on. We propose an approach to managing and mining sensor data inside RDBMSs that exploits the Matrix Profile concept. A Matrix Profile is a data structure that annotates a time series through the index of and the distance to the nearest neighbor of each subsequence of the time series and serves as a basis to discover motifs, anomalies, and other time-series data mining primitives. This approach is implemented as a PostgreSQL extension that allows an application programmer both to compute matrix profiles and mining primitives and to represent them as relational tables. Experimental case studies show that our approach surpasses the above-mentioned out-of-TSDBMS competitors in terms of performance since it assumes that sensor data are mined inside a TSDBMS at no significant overhead costs.},
