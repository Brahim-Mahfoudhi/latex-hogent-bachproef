Two low-cost motion detectors, namely, pyroelectric infrared radial (PIR) and microwave sensors are considered in this work, and a Raspberry Pi is selected as the main platform to receive the sensor signals and send a push notification to the user whenever an intruder is detected. The performance of each sensor was firstly analysed in terms of its detection accuracy and false activation. A series of experiments were designed in a car porch area with various walking trajectories to evaluate the accuracy of each sensor, and three environmental scenario with different wind speeds were considered for the evaluation on false triggers. We also introduce a simple algorithm for each sensor to minimize the effects from the sensors' noise. Based on the experimental results, it is shown that the microwave sensor outperforms the PIR in terms of both detection accuracy and false activation. It is also observed that, the implementation of the algorithm offers a great reduction in terms of false activation, but with a slight trade-off in motion detection accuracy. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the microwave sensor is enhanced as the false trigger can be totally eliminated at the cost of only 5{\%} accuracy reduction, compared to that of the PIR sensor which still shows a non-zero false triggers with 6.25{\%} accuracy reduction after the implementation of the algorithm.},

The novel technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) connects objects to the Internet and its most advanced applications refine obtained data for the user. We propose that Internet of Things technology can be used to promote basic nursing care in the hospital environment by improving the quality of care and patient safety.
Objectives
To introduce the concept of Internet of Things to nursing audience by exploring the state of the art of Internet of Things based technology for basic nursing care in the hospital environment.
Data sources and review methods
Scoping review methodology following Arksey & O’Malley’s stages from one to five were used to explore the extent, range, and nature of current literature. We searched eight databases using predefined search terms. A total of 5030 retrievals were found which were screened for duplications and relevancy to the study topic. 265 papers were chosen for closer screening of the abstracts and 93 for full text evaluation. 62 papers were selected for the review. The constructs of the papers, the Internet of Things based innovations and the themes of basic nursing care in hospital environment were identified.
Results
Most of the papers included in the review were peer-reviewed proceedings of technological conferences or articles published in technological journals. The Internet of Things based innovations were presented in methodology papers or tested in case studies and usability assessments. Innovations were identified in several topics in four basic nursing care activities: comprehensive assessment, periodical clinical reassessment, activities of daily living and care management.
Conclusions
Internet of Things technology is providing innovations for the use of basic nursing care although the innovations are emerging and still in early stages. Internet of things is yet vaguely adopted in nursing. The possibilities of the Internet of Things are not yet exploited as well as they could. Nursing science might benefit from deeper involvement in engineering research in the area of health.},

Technologies (e.g., Internet-of-Things, Edge-of-Things, and Cloud-of-Things) in healthcare systems are going through a transformation where health monitoring of people is possible without hospitalization. The advancement of sensing technologies helps to make it possible to develop smart systems to monitor human behaviors continuously. In this work, a wearable sensor-based system is proposed for activity prediction using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on an edge device (i.e., personal computer or laptop). The input data of the system are obtained from multiple wearable healthcare sensors such as electrocardiography (ECG), magnetometer, accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Then, an RNN is trained based on the features. The trained RNN is used for predicting the activities. The system has been compared against the conventional approaches on a publicly available standard dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other traditional methods. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in the edge device is utilized to take the advantage of fast computation of experimental data.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between technology and healthcare society rises due to the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) with endless networking capabilities for medical data analysis. Deep Neural Networks and the swift public embracement of medical wearable have been productively metamorphosed in the recent few years. Deep Neural Network-powered IoT allowed innovative developments for medical society and distinctive probabilities to the medical data analysis in the healthcare industry (Yin, Yang, Zhang, & Oki, 2016). Despite this progress, several issues still required to be handled while concerning the quality of service. The key to flourishing in the shift from client-oriented to patient-oriented medical data analysis for healthcare society is applying deep networks to provide a high level of quality in key attributes such as end-to-end response time, overhead and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Neural Network-driven IoT smart health care method called, Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network (GFB-CNN) based on real-time analytics. In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-driven IoT eHealth architecture based on the Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network in which the key quality of service parameters like, time and overhead is reduced with a higher rate of accuracy. The feasibility of the method is investigated using a comprehensive Mobile HEALTH (MHEALTH) dataset. This illustrative example discusses and addresses all important aspects of the proposed method from design suggestions such as corresponding overheads, time, accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By simulation, the performance of GFB-CNN method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods with various synthetically generated scenarios. Results show that with minimal time and overhead incurred for sensing and data collection, our method accurately evaluates medical data analysis for heart signals by efficient differentiation between healthy and unhealthy heart signals.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare monitoring systems in hospitals and other health centers have witnessed throughout the last decade a tremendous growth and wireless healthcare monitoring devices with various technologies have become of great interest in many nations around the world. The proposed paper aims at integrating artificial intelligence technology, such as the neural networks and fuzzy system in a secure healthcare monitoring system in order to enable the system to work as a smart healthcare model that decides the priority by itself depending on the collected health parameters from the senor nodes. The proposed model consists of a trust environment that is responsible for collecting authenticated physiological data from patient's body which is then sent through GSM module to Azure IoT Hub where raw data is converted into linguistic representation, with the help of logic-based algorithm, which is trained in fuzzy-based inference system (FBIS) to get the status of the patient. The proposed system, then, provides reliable, accurate, secure and real-time patient monitoring. The following sections describe how the FBIS can be integrated with a secure healthcare monitoring system to get the states of the patient and send it to the medical advisory for the preliminary precautions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Background and Aims The Internet of Things (IoTs) is a set of connected objects and devices that share data and pursue a common goal in different areas. IoT technology can significantly help the healthcare system by enabling the monitoring of elderly and chronic disease patients. Along with the growth of this technology, its challenges and limitations such as Connectivity, Compatibility, Standards, cost, legal, and ethical also increase. One of the most critical and challenging issues in the IoT is ethical issues. This study aims to explore the key ethical aspects of the IoT and Categorize them based on the executive phases of IoT in healthcare. Methods The current study was conducted in two phases using the mixed-method approach. In the first phase, a systematic review was conducted in relevant databases to identify ethical issues of the IoT. In the second phase, a focus group discussion was conducted to classify the extracted data elements based on executive phases of IoT by medical informatics experts and computer engineerings. Results Among the 138 papers retrieved through the search strategy, 11 articles were selected, and 12 ethical issues related to IoT were identified. The obtained results revealed the importance of ethical issues of IoT, including security, confidentiality, privacy, anonymity, freedom to withdraw, informed consent, integrity, availability, authorization, access control, censoring, and eavesdropping. They were classified into five main categories of executive phases of IoT based on the five experts’ opinions affiliated with SUMS, including data collection, data storage, data process, data transmission, and data delivery. Conclusion Because of the key role of the IoT in disease prevention, real-time tele-monitoring of patient's functions, testing of treatments, health management, and health research, considering the risks relating to Health care and patient data is essential. Moreover, health policymakers should be aware of the ethical commitment to using IoT technology.},

The validation of the operation of this prototype is carried out through the Flexsim queue simulator, through which random cases are generated from branch offices referenced from Google Maps. With this, it is possible to give a hierarchical order according to the shortest waiting time and indicating the location of these points of care on the map. In order to implement the application it is necessary to install sensors in the points of care, linked to an online database through IoT, so that this information can be visualized in the mobile application.},

The long waiting time without any status updates is the most common complaint, concerning health officials. In this paper, UrNext, a location-aware mobile-based solution using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology is presented to solve the problem. Recently, a technology-oriented method, the Internet of Things (IoT), has been gaining popularity in helping to solve some of the healthcare sector’s problems. The implementation of this solution could be illustrated through a simple example of when a patient arrives at a clinic for a consultation. Instead of having to wait in long lines, that patient will be greeted automatically, receive a push notification of an admittance along with an estimated waiting time for a consultation session. This will not only provide the patients with a sense of freedom but would also reduce the uncertainty levels that are generally observed, thus saving both time and money. This work aims to improve the clinics’ quality of services, organize queues and minimize waiting times, leading to patients’ comfort while reducing the burden on nurses and receptionists. The results demonstrate that the presented system is successful in its performance and helps achieves a pleasant and conducive clinic visitation process with higher productivity.},

The reason for integrating healthcare with Internet of Things features into medical devices improves the quality and effectiveness of service, bringing especially high value for elderly, patients with chronic conditions and those that require consistent supervision. Now research is going on-how to transform healthcare industry by increasing efficiency, lowering costs and put the focus back on better patient care. The Internet of Things will be a game changer for the healthcare industry. With an intelligent system and powerful algorithms, one can obtain an unprecedented level of real-time, life-critical data which is captured and analyzed to drive people in advance research, management and critical care. Taking care of patient's health at very low cost is an important factor. The main idea of applying IoT in healthcare is move out from traditional area to visit hospitals and thus waiting will come to an end. The concept here is that it can be able to sense, process and communicate with biomedical and physical parameters so that they can work on it. Many applications and devices have been designed for healthcare purpose and have been put for people to use. The view is to connect the doctors, patients and nurses via smart device and each entity can roam without any restrictions. The idea is 24 * 7 monitoring of patient.},

WSN based IoT has become key technology in achieving real-time quality of service (QoS), low-cost operation and long-term reliability. IoT based WSN nodes, permits interconnection of various objects wirelessly and these nodes are tiny, equipped with irreplaceable battery and are resource constrain. Due to continuous sensing and gathering, IoT produce huge volume of data which may results in high computation overhead, data redundancy, packet collision and high energy consumption. To address resource constrains, significant research has been conducted to optimize energy consumption of nodes to extend network lifetime. Most of the existing methods focus on extending network lifetime by scheduling method through duty cycles, however these methods fails to handle data redundancy and has lower throughput. Cluster based data aggregation schemes have offered solution to eliminate data redundancy and harvest energy. In this paper we propose an efficient data aggregation scheme (EDAS) for IoT based WSN, this scheme considers improved low energy adaptive clustering algorithm (I-LEACH) to form optimal number of cluster head (CH), by considering node residual energy and average network energy. Data redundancy is eliminated using network coding, this technique integrates liner XOR operation and ensures non-replicated data transmissions. Finally, we performed simulations of proposed EDAS scheme to evaluate network parameters and performance of EDAS is compared with existing schemes.},

  abstract  = {As fog computing brings compute and storage resources to the edge of the network, there is an increasing need for automated placement (i.e., selection of hosting devices) to deploy distributed applications. Such a placement must conform to applications' resource requirements in a heterogeneous fog infrastructure. The placement decision-making is further complicated by Internet of Things (IoT) applications that are tied to geographical locations of physical objects/things. This paper presents a model, an objective function, and a mechanism to address the problem of placing distributed IoT applications in the fog. Based on a backtrack search algorithm and accompanied heuristics, the proposed mechanism is able to deal with large scale problems, and to efficiently make placement decisions that fit the objective---to lower placed applications' response time. The proposed approach is validated through comparative simulations of different combinations of the algorithms and heuristics on varying sizes of infrastructures and applications.},

  abstract       = {Extended Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has recently gained a lot of attention from the industrial and research community for dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT devices broadcast messages for neighbor gateways that deliver the message to the application server through an IP network. Hence, it is required to deploy LoRaWAN gateways, i.e., network planning, and optimization, in an environment while considering Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) along with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this article, we introduced a LoRaWAN gateway placement model for dynamic IoT applications called DPLACE. It divides the IoT devices into groups with some degree of similarity between them to allow for the placement of LoRaWAN gateways that can serve these devices in the best possible way. Specifically, DPLACE computes the number of LoRaWAN gateways based on the Gap statistics method. Afterward, DPLACE uses K-Means and Fuzzy C-means algorithms to calculate the LoRaWAN gateway placement. The simulations’ results proved the benefits of DPLACE compared to state-of-the-art LoRaWAN gateway placement models in terms of OPEX, CAPEX, and QoS.},

  abstract       = {In the past decade, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have become more and more pervasive, allowing the development of Ambient Intelligence and Context Awareness applications. While the smart home is the chosen scenario for such technologies, a variety of environments could potentially benefit from the synergies between IoT and digital applications. Among them, the clinical waiting rooms is an environment facing several challenges, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical waiting rooms are crowded places associated with stress and anxiety, often linked to patients’ idling time. Nonetheless, the rise of IoT-enabled telehealth has focused attention on the possibility of changing the functions of clinical waiting rooms. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the existing solutions for “smart waiting rooms”. The review process started with 278 works, and it identified 16 papers relevant to the topic of smart clinical waiting rooms. Moreover, the results of this review underlined that waiting rooms are a neglected research area that could take advantage of IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance patients’ experience and support the diagnostic process. Leveraging the research directions identified in the review process, this work proposes a “Smart Waiting Room” that exploits virtual reality (VR), AI, and IoT technologies to support the diagnostic process (via a cognitive assessment) and the personalization of the patient’s context—taking into account the features of the physical environment. The prototypical smart waiting room constitutes an example of the potentialities of novel technologies applied to healthcare and can contribute to shaping the future of clinical waiting rooms.},

This will useful in all the areas and easy implementation. In that sense, in this paper I suggested the concept of Infrared radiation for motion detection by using PIR sensor. That sensor is implemented with the microcontroller which identifies the intruders movement which represented by high and low. This represents the motion detection, if the value is high there is a motion of intrusion, otherwise if the value is low it shows does not intruded by anyone. This technique is very compatible because only it requires three components it is detected by mixed signal processor and line transceiver.},

  abstract       = {Fluxgate magnetic sensors are especially important in detecting weak magnetic fields. The mechanism of a fluxgate magnetic sensor is based on Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The structure of a fluxgate magnetic sensor mainly consists of excitation windings, core and sensing windings, similar to the structure of a transformer. To date, they have been applied to many fields such as geophysics and astro-observations, wearable electronic devices and non-destructive testing. In this review, we report the recent progress in both the basic research and applications of fluxgate magnetic sensors, especially in the past two years. Regarding the basic research, we focus on the progress in lowering the noise, better calibration methods and increasing the sensitivity. Concerning applications, we introduce recent work about fluxgate magnetometers on spacecraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, wearable electronic devices and defect detection in coiled tubing. Based on the above work, we hope that we can have a clearer prospect about the future research direction of fluxgate magnetic sensor.},

  abstract     = {In the current scenario, IoT is an ideal and novel technology, which fulfills the needs of most of the commercial, non-commercial, government, and private organizations by its real-time supportive nature and characteristics. However, real-time processing itself a very critical research topic. But, most of the IoT applications are empowered by real-time data processing. Thus, it become a vital part of IoT. In this work, we proposed a four-layer infrastructure for IoT along with stream processing. Further, we use stream processing techniques along with IoT infrastructure for applications and analyze the performance of stream processing techniques for IoT applications. Also, we compare and find the five most suitable distributed stream processing systems for IoT, based on its performance and characteristics. We use two benchmark applications to evaluate the performance of distributed stream processing systems against response time, throughput, jitter, and scalability. Based on that, we suggest the adapted solution for IoT applications. We evaluate the performance with peak stream rates from 100k to 1M along with the various frequencies of benchmark applications. Further, on the basis of results, we conclude that Apache NiFi is the most suitable solution for IoT applications.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, having sensors and getting more data can be irrelevant without real-time insights. This process is not trivial in a ``smart'' urban ecosystem, both for businesses and Public Administrations (PAs). The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) together with data sharing both at the front-end and the back-end sides promises to advantage the entire urban metabolism thus (i) going beyond the old ``silos logic'' and (ii) allowing the growth of shared knowledge. In this work we present a case study based on the implementation of the InfluxDB time series database for monitoring and analytics in distributed IoT environments. The goal is to enable IoT-as-a-Service in geo-distributed ``smart'' ecosystems thus creating new opportunities for heterogeneous stakeholders (i.e., people, PA, academia, industries) to meet and define new synergies.},

  abstractnote = {This study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can be incorporated into the Internet of Things (IoT), with a particular focus on using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano as a specialized AI platform. The aim is to boost the functional capabilities of IoT devices, allowing them to independently carry out sophisticated data analysis and decision-making tasks to heighten their efficiency and effectiveness. The paper begins by outlining the motivation for this investigation, then proceeds with a literature review to evaluate the prospective applications, challenges, and benefits of AI in IoT environments. It explores in detail the technical attributes of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, including its compact design, robust computing power, and the availability of software libraries that facilitate the deployment of AI models on devices with limited resources. A prototype IoT device equipped with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano was developed at Tien Giang University. This device is capable of capturing video and executing AI algorithms for real-time analysis, thereby deriving crucial data for IoT decision-making processes. The outcomes and structure of this prototype exhibit the potential for wider application, particularly in facial recognition technologies. The discussion on this subject extends beyond the confines of this document, indicating ongoing developments and enhancements.},

  abstract       = {The development of low-cost miniaturized thermal cameras has expanded the use of remotely sensed surface temperature and promoted advances in applications involving proximal and aerial data acquisition. However, deriving accurate temperature readings from these cameras is often challenging due to the sensitivity of the sensor, which changes according to the internal temperature. Moreover, the photogrammetry processing required to produce orthomosaics from aerial images can also be problematic and introduce errors to the temperature readings. In this study, we assessed the performance of the FLIR Lepton 3.5 camera in both proximal and aerial conditions based on precision and accuracy indices derived from reference temperature measurements. The aerial analysis was conducted using three flight altitudes replicated along the day, exploring the effect of the distance between the camera and the target, and the blending mode configuration used to create orthomosaics. During the tests, the camera was able to deliver results within the accuracy reported by the manufacturer when using factory calibration, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.08 °C for proximal condition and ≤3.18 °C during aerial missions. Results among different flight altitudes revealed that the overall precision remained stable (R² = 0.94–0.96), contrasting with the accuracy results, decreasing towards higher flight altitudes due to atmospheric attenuation, which is not accounted by factory calibration (RMSE = 2.63–3.18 °C). The blending modes tested also influenced the final accuracy, with the best results obtained with the average (RMSE = 3.14 °C) and disabled mode (RMSE = 3.08 °C). Furthermore, empirical line calibration models using ground reference targets were tested, reducing the errors on temperature measurements by up to 1.83 °C, with a final accuracy better than 2 °C. Other important results include a simplified co-registering method developed to overcome alignment issues encountered during orthomosaic creation using non-geotagged thermal images, and a set of insights and recommendations to reduce errors when deriving temperature readings from aerial thermal imaging.},

  abstract  = {The rising interest in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and IoT-based systems worldwide, have revolutionized the normal way of doing business, especially in institutions of higher learning. One of the major challenges within academic institutions is the management of space in their libraries, allowing users to book or reserve a seat for a particular time. It is common to find students and staff complaining daily about how exhausting it is to find a space in the library. This is because one needs to physically walk and look for a vacant space for study, and this challenge has raised the need for a technological solution that is smart. Literature found that most smart library systems focused on seat occupancy detection and book reservation, whereas only a few smart library systems were developed in South Africa (SA). As far as could be established, however, there is a gap in the literature on seat reservation based on estimated arrival time, and reliable seat occupancy status, which needs to be filled. This paper aims to develop an IoT-based smart library seat occupancy and reservation (IoT-SLSOR) prototype, using the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) technologies. The choice of the prototype, as an innovative solution for Universities of Technology in South Africa (SA) was made because of its features and functionalities that improve transparency and builds a relationship between library users and their study facilities. Using this prototype, they would get real time access to their library seat occupancy status, and this would enable them to reserve seats online. The developed prototype was piloted using students and staff members at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), to prove the accuracy and feasibility of the research objectives. The results, using the prototype revealed an accuracy rate of approximately 99 percent.},
