abstract="Nowadays, having sensors and getting more data can be irrelevant without real-time insights. This process is not trivial in a ``smart'' urban ecosystem, both for businesses and Public Administrations (PAs). The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) together with data sharing both at the front-end and the back-end sides promises to advantage the entire urban metabolism thus (i) going beyond the old ``silos logic'' and (ii) allowing the growth of shared knowledge. In this work we present a case study based on the implementation of the InfluxDB time series database for monitoring and analytics in distributed IoT environments. The goal is to enable IoT-as-a-Service in geo-distributed ``smart'' ecosystems thus creating new opportunities for heterogeneous stakeholders (i.e., people, PA, academia, industries) to meet and define new synergies.",
