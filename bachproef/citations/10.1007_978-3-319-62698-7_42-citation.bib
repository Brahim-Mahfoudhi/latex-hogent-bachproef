abstract="This paper shows the development of a mobile application prototype that allows the identification of the average waiting times in a queuing system for different branch offices or points of care. This application gives a person the possibility to select the alternative that best suits him/her, showing the nearby points of care by average waiting times in each point. The validation of the operation of this prototype is carried out through the Flexsim queue simulator, through which random cases are generated from branch offices referenced from Google Maps. With this, it is possible to give a hierarchical order according to the shortest waiting time and indicating the location of these points of care on the map. In order to implement the application it is necessary to install sensors in the points of care, linked to an online database through IoT, so that this information can be visualized in the mobile application.",
