abstract="The field of automation technology has been so much improved, and the recent technologies have made the life of people simpler in every aspect. In today's world, automatic systems are being preferred over manual system in all fields that even replaces the remote control mechanisms with automation, such that manpower can be reduced. The incredible increase in the users of internet over recent times has made Internet a much-needed thing in everyday life, with IoT being the latest and emerging Internet technology. Internet of things is a growing field of network which can be used in every industry and machinery that can share information and complete tasks in seconds over Internet which could consume more time if done manually. Accelerometer based home automation system using IoT is a system that uses accelerometer sensor data to control home appliances automatically through Internet based on the tilting actions of the sensor in different directions. It saves electric power and manpower. The home automation system is different from the other manual systems such that it provides the user with the ability to control the system from anywhere around the world provided a Wi-Fi or Internet connection is available.",
