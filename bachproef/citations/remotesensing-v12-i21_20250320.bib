ABSTRACT = {The development of low-cost miniaturized thermal cameras has expanded the use of remotely sensed surface temperature and promoted advances in applications involving proximal and aerial data acquisition. However, deriving accurate temperature readings from these cameras is often challenging due to the sensitivity of the sensor, which changes according to the internal temperature. Moreover, the photogrammetry processing required to produce orthomosaics from aerial images can also be problematic and introduce errors to the temperature readings. In this study, we assessed the performance of the FLIR Lepton 3.5 camera in both proximal and aerial conditions based on precision and accuracy indices derived from reference temperature measurements. The aerial analysis was conducted using three flight altitudes replicated along the day, exploring the effect of the distance between the camera and the target, and the blending mode configuration used to create orthomosaics. During the tests, the camera was able to deliver results within the accuracy reported by the manufacturer when using factory calibration, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.08 °C for proximal condition and ≤3.18 °C during aerial missions. Results among different flight altitudes revealed that the overall precision remained stable (R² = 0.94–0.96), contrasting with the accuracy results, decreasing towards higher flight altitudes due to atmospheric attenuation, which is not accounted by factory calibration (RMSE = 2.63–3.18 °C). The blending modes tested also influenced the final accuracy, with the best results obtained with the average (RMSE = 3.14 °C) and disabled mode (RMSE = 3.08 °C). Furthermore, empirical line calibration models using ground reference targets were tested, reducing the errors on temperature measurements by up to 1.83 °C, with a final accuracy better than 2 °C. Other important results include a simplified co-registering method developed to overcome alignment issues encountered during orthomosaic creation using non-geotagged thermal images, and a set of insights and recommendations to reduce errors when deriving temperature readings from aerial thermal imaging.},
