abstract = {This paper proposes the design of a low-cost, low-power and small size image acquisition device to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications which collects, processes and sends image data through a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection. The proposed processing unit is a low-cost high-performance STM32F7 microcontroller which is able to acquire and transfer images at full rate keeping the core idle to do image processing. The device is supported by a 1.3 Megapixel CMOS camera sensor, and a low consumption Wi-Fi module. This setup allows to create a very compact image sensor device with a built-in processing algorithm for a specific functionality in IoT. In this work, the device hardware architecture is described and discussed, and a comparison with alternative hardware solutions are presented.}
