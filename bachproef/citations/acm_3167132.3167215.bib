abstract = {As fog computing brings compute and storage resources to the edge of the network, there is an increasing need for automated placement (i.e., selection of hosting devices) to deploy distributed applications. Such a placement must conform to applications' resource requirements in a heterogeneous fog infrastructure. The placement decision-making is further complicated by Internet of Things (IoT) applications that are tied to geographical locations of physical objects/things. This paper presents a model, an objective function, and a mechanism to address the problem of placing distributed IoT applications in the fog. Based on a backtrack search algorithm and accompanied heuristics, the proposed mechanism is able to deal with large scale problems, and to efficiently make placement decisions that fit the objective---to lower placed applications' response time. The proposed approach is validated through comparative simulations of different combinations of the algorithms and heuristics on varying sizes of infrastructures and applications.},
