abstract = {The IoT-Based Parking Monitoring System using Magnetometer as the Sensor is developed to detect the presence of cars in parking slots and to collect all the data from the sensor to be displayed in a mobile application so that user can easily find the empty parking slot. The system consists of four types of hardware and two types of software. This four hardware are magnetometer sensors, repeaters, gateways, and LED displays. Whereas the software are the hardware programming and a mobile application. The system developed has been successful in detecting all the present and absence of the car with 100% accuracy and displaying all the information needed into LED displays and mobile application for the service purposes.}
