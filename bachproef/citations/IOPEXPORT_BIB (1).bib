abstract = {An IoT is the recent trend today which is applicable to all the real time applications. It is applied in all the sectors like smart city, home, appliance, Security as most important one which reduces the human operation and do all the works are done in automation. This will useful in all the areas and easy implementation. In that sense, in this paper I suggested the concept of Infrared radiation for motion detection by using PIR sensor. That sensor is implemented with the microcontroller which identifies the intruders movement which represented by high and low. This represents the motion detection, if the value is high there is a motion of intrusion, otherwise if the value is low it shows does not intruded by anyone. This technique is very compatible because only it requires three components it is detected by mixed signal processor and line transceiver.}
