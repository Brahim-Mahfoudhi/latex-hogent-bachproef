abstract = {The rising interest in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and IoT-based systems worldwide, have revolutionized the normal way of doing business, especially in institutions of higher learning. One of the major challenges within academic institutions is the management of space in their libraries, allowing users to book or reserve a seat for a particular time. It is common to find students and staff complaining daily about how exhausting it is to find a space in the library. This is because one needs to physically walk and look for a vacant space for study, and this challenge has raised the need for a technological solution that is smart. Literature found that most smart library systems focused on seat occupancy detection and book reservation, whereas only a few smart library systems were developed in South Africa (SA). As far as could be established, however, there is a gap in the literature on seat reservation based on estimated arrival time, and reliable seat occupancy status, which needs to be filled. This paper aims to develop an IoT-based smart library seat occupancy and reservation (IoT-SLSOR) prototype, using the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) technologies. The choice of the prototype, as an innovative solution for Universities of Technology in South Africa (SA) was made because of its features and functionalities that improve transparency and builds a relationship between library users and their study facilities. Using this prototype, they would get real time access to their library seat occupancy status, and this would enable them to reserve seats online. The developed prototype was piloted using students and staff members at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), to prove the accuracy and feasibility of the research objectives. The results, using the prototype revealed an accuracy rate of approximately 99 percent.},
