abstract = {The change of an object's position with respect to time and a reference point is usually adopted to determine its velocity. This is usually a function of time. Velocity can be deduced in terms of its speed and direction of motion. It is an important concept in the description of kinematics and mechanics of bodies which entails the definitions of the bodies magnitude and direction. This project is one of the teaching series of smart technology development for the step change and technological awareness on the introduction of the IoT global influx. It focuses on the measurement of velocity using ultrasonic sensor. The Ultrasonic module HC - SR04 that has a range between 2 cm - 400 cm and a non-contact measurement function was adopted and linked to the Arduino UNO board for data processing and conversion before the output displays the specific measurement of the object velocity. The accuracy of the Ultrasonic module HC - SR04 ranges up to 3 mm. This module comprises of the ultrasonic transmitters, the receiver and the control circuit [1]. This is to teach and encourage students within the developing countries such as Nigeria to exploit and contribute to the global trend of the IoT smart technology advancement.},
