abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) has become a new trend in the healthcare system which provides a high diversity of efficacious services for healthcare professionals as well as patients' treatments for various diseases. In IoT healthcare system application design consists of devices, network, layered model, and Communication Application/Protocols. Mostly in studies, in fact, IoT provides several benefits, and it also facing different security challenges in their patient record hierarchy. Due to the fact of private and sympathetic data of patients, required complete security and privacy are a key issue in the formation of IoT-based systems in the healthcare sector. The aim of this study is to investigate the security-related issues of IoT in the health sector. In this study, we compiled searched articles that are published in well-reputed journals from 2015 to 2021 for constructing the summary of related challenges. We construct a table that analyzes the security-related issues of IoT in the healthcare sector. Moreover, an IoT healthcare architecture has been proposed that represents the effective patient discovery solution in the field of health care. Our study sketches the open and recent security issues of IoT in the healthcare sector.",
