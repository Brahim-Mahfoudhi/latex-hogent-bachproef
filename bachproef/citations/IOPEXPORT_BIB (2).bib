abstract = {Image sensors are used in all digital cameras, mobile phones and all other devices where images are to be captured. The most common parameter used by consumers to compare the different cameras is the pixel array size which is usually given in Mega pixels. The image quality is better with a higher megapixel count. Another parameter to distinguish between the different cameras is the type of imaging technology used like CMOS (Complementary metal oxide semiconductor) or CCD (Charge coupled devices). In this review we will present the working principles of an image sensor and conversion of light to electrical signals and subsequently to an image. The functional differences between the CCD and CMOS sensors will also be presented.}
