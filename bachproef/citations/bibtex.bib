The aim is to boost the functional capabilities of IoT devices, allowing them to independently carry out sophisticated data analysis and decision-making tasks to heighten their efficiency and effectiveness. The paper begins by outlining the motivation for this investigation, then proceeds with a literature review to evaluate the prospective applications, challenges, and benefits of AI in IoT environments. It explores in detail the technical attributes of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, including its compact design, robust computing power, and the availability of software libraries that facilitate the deployment of AI models on devices with limited resources. A prototype IoT device equipped with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano was developed at Tien Giang University. This device is capable of capturing video and executing AI algorithms for real-time analysis, thereby deriving crucial data for IoT decision-making processes. The outcomes and structure of this prototype exhibit the potential for wider application, particularly in facial recognition technologies. The discussion on this subject extends beyond the confines of this document, indicating ongoing developments and enhancements.}, number={3}, journal={Dalat University Journal of Science}, author={Pham, Ngoc Giau and Bui, Nhien Loc and Tran, Quang Hien and Tong, Le Thanh Hai and Tran, Hong Ngoc}, year={2024}, month={Sep.}, pages={39â€“64} }
