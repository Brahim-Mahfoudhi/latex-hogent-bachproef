  abstract     = {The English National Health Service (NHS) has failed to meet the four-hour waiting time target to admit, transfer or discharge 95 per cent of patients attending Accident and Emergency Departments (A&E) since 2013. A growing number of patients requiring inpatient care are waiting on trolleys longer than four hours before admission to a hospital bed. This study examines the role of bed occupancy in the deterioration of A&E performance in the NHS. Longitudinal panel data methods are used to analyse hospital data (n = 72,129,886) for 143 Trusts from 1st June 2016 to 31st October 2019. The average bed occupancy rate across the study period was 93.2%. A 1% increase in bed occupancy was associated with a 9.5 percentage point decrease in the Trusts’ probabilitay of meeting the waiting target, and an approximately 6 patient increase in four hours to 12 -hs trolley waits per 1,000 admissions. These relationships became more pronounced with rising bed occupancy levels above a 90% threshold. Bed occupancy is associated with significant negative spill-over effects on A&E performance. We estimate a minimum investment in 3,861 additional inpatient beds across the NHS to improve A&E performance in England. Relevant lessons can be derived for health care systems that have observed similar trends in increasing bed occupancy and deteriorations in A&E performance, including Ireland, Canada and Israel.},

  abstract     = {Background
We describe a novel technique for continuous real-time assessment of myocardial ischaemia using a three-axis accelerometer.
Methods
In 14 anaesthetized open-chest pigs, two accelerometers were sutured on the left ventricle (LV) surface in the perfusion areas of the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (CX) arteries. Acceleration was measured in the longitudinal, circumferential, and radial directions, and the corresponding epicardial velocities were calculated. Regional LV dysfunction was induced by LAD occlusion for 60 s. Global LV function was altered by nitroprusside, epinephrine, esmolol, and fluid loading. Epicardial velocities were compared with strain by echocardiography during LAD occlusion and with aortic flow and LV dP/dtmax during interventions on global LV function.
Results
LAD occlusion induced ischaemia, shown by lengthening in systolic strain in the LV apical anterior region (P<0.01) and concurrent changes in LAD accelerometer circumferential velocities during systole (P<0.01) and during the isovolumic relaxation phase (P<0.01). The changes in accelerometer circumferential velocities during LAD occlusion were greater compared with the changes during the interventions on global function (P<0.01). For the LAD accelerometer circumferential velocities, sensitivity was 94–100% and specificity was 92–94% in detecting ischaemia.
Conclusions
Myocardial ischaemia can be detected with epicardial three-axis accelerometers. The accelerometer had the ability to distinguish ischaemia from interventions altering global myocardial function. This novel technique may be used for continuous real-time monitoring of myocardial ischaemia during and after cardiac surgery.},

The mechanism of a fluxgate magnetic sensor is based on Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The structure of a fluxgate magnetic sensor mainly consists of excitation windings, core and sensing windings, similar to the structure of a transformer. To date, they have been applied to many fields such as geophysics and astro-observations, wearable electronic devices and non-destructive testing. In this review, we report the recent progress in both the basic research and applications of fluxgate magnetic sensors, especially in the past two years. Regarding the basic research, we focus on the progress in lowering the noise, better calibration methods and increasing the sensitivity. Concerning applications, we introduce recent work about fluxgate magnetometers on spacecraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, wearable electronic devices and defect detection in coiled tubing. Based on the above work, we hope that we can have a clearer prospect about the future research direction of fluxgate magnetic sensor.},

  abstract     = {Hospitals play an important role towards ensuring proper health treatment to human beings. One of the major challenges faced in this context refers to the increasingly overcrowded patients queues, which contribute to a potential deterioration of patients health conditions. One of the reasons of such an inefficiency is a poor allocation of health professionals. In particular, such allocation process is usually unable to properly adapt to unexpected changes in the patients demand. As a consequence, it is frequently the case where underused rooms have idle professionals whilst overused rooms have less professionals than necessary. Previous works addressed this issue by analyzing the evolution of supply (doctors) and demand (patients) so as to better adjust one to the other, though none of them focused on proposing effective counter-measures to mitigate poor allocations. In this paper, we build upon the concept of smart hospitals and introduce elastic allocation of human resources in healthcare environments (ElHealth), an IoT-focused model able to monitor patients usage of hospital rooms and to adapt the allocation of health professionals to these rooms so as to meet patients needs. ElHealth employs data prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand of a given room will exceeds its capacity, and to propose actions to allocate health professionals accordingly. We also introduce the concept of multi-level predictive elasticity of human resources (which is an extension of the concept of resource elasticity, from cloud computing) to manage the use of human resources at different levels of a healthcare environment. Furthermore, we devise the concept of proactive human resources elastic speedup (which is an extension of the speedup concept, from parallel computing) to properly measure the gain of healthcare time with dynamic parallel use of human resources within hospital environments. ElHealth was thoroughly evaluated based on simulations of a hospital environment using data from a Brazilian polyclinic, and obtained promising results, decreasing the waiting time by up to 96.71%.},

  abstract       = {One of the primal challenges faced by utility companies is ensuring efficient supply with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. The advent of smart meters and smart grids provide an unprecedented advantage in realizing an optimised supply of thermal energies through proactive techniques such as load forecasting. In this paper, we propose a forecasting framework for heat demand based on neural networks where the time series are encoded as scalograms equipped with the capacity of embedding exogenous variables. Subsequently, CNNs are utilized to predict the heat load multi-step ahead. Finally, the proposed framework is compared with other state-of-the-art methods, such as SARIMAX and LSTM. The quantitative results from retrospective experiments show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline method with real-world data acquired from Denmark. A minimal mean error of 7.54% for MAPE and 417 kW for RMSE is achieved with the proposed framework in comparison to all other methods.<br},
